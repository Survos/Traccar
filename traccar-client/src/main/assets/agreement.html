    <h4>ABOUT THE STUDY</h4>
    <p>
    <h4>WHAT IS INFORMED CONSENT?</h4>
    <p>The purpose of this page is to help you decide if you want to be in the study. Please scroll through and read this entire page carefully. To join a research study you must give your informed consent. “Informed consent” includes [1] reading this page and [2] asking questions about anything that is not clear to you. You should not join this study until all of your questions are answered.</p>
    <h4>STUDY DESCRIPTION</h4>
    <p>The purpose of this study is to help researchers understand the way advertising and the retail environment affect the decisions people make about their health.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The study researchers will measure when and how often people come into contact with retail stores.</li>
        <li>Participants will work with the study researchers to track their location during the study period by using a smartphone app that they will download on their iPhone or Android phone. The app will need to be turned on during the entire study period. Study staff may call, text, or email you to remind you to keep the app turned on.</li>
        <li>We cannot guarantee that the TeliTrax app will work on all iPhone or Android models.</li>
        <li>You will be asked to provide your phone number and email address so that study researchers can contact you to resolve any technical issues with the app, or to remind you to keep the app turned on. Your name and contact information will never be linked to the location information collected by your app.</li>
        <li>The location information collected from your smartphone app will be linked to your responses to the CHAT surveys you have completed. This information will be linked using a confidential code; never with your name or other identifying information.</li>
        <li>
            Incentives for participating include:
            <ul>
                <li>$30 Amazon gift card for downloading the smartphone app</li>
                <li>
                    $50 Amazon gift card monthly drawing
                    <ul>
                        <li>Participants are eligible for entry in the drawing if they have kept the smartphone tracking app turned on for at least 8 hours a day for at least 24 days per month.</li>
                        <li>There will be 10 winners per month.</li>
                        <li>Winners will be randomly selected during the first week of every month and will be notified by email.</li>
                        <li>All eligible participants have equal chance of winning.</li>
                        <li>Participants are not required to pay anything for entry in the drawing.</li>
                        <li>Should a participant win the drawing more than 7 times in one year, he/she will receive a $35 gift card instead of a $50 gift card for any drawing won during the remainder of that year. This reduced incentive it due to IRS tax regulations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
